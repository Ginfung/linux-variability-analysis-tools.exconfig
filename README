The extractor is used to construct 'extract' files that are used by the LVAT
tools.

Running it
----------

A precompiled version for x86 (32-bit) is available under the bin/ directory.
By default, the extractor will use arch/x86/Kconfig as the base Kconfig file.
You can optionally provide an explicit base Kconfig file. The working
directory MUST be the base directory of the Linux source files (i.e.
linux-2.6.xx). To run the extractor:

    ./exconf-i386 [base Kconfig file (optional)]
