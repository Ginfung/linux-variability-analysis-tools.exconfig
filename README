---

The extractor is used to construct 'extract' files that are used by the LVAT
tools.

Running it
----------

A precompiled version for x86 (32-bit) is available under the bin/ directory.
By default, the extractor will use arch/x86/Kconfig as the base Kconfig file.
You can optionally provide an explicit base Kconfig file. The working
directory MUST be the base directory of the Linux source files (i.e.
linux-2.6.xx). To run the extractor:

    ./exconf-i386 [base Kconfig file (optional)]

Compiling it
------------

If you want to compile the source code, you must copy the extractor source to
the directory scripts/kconfig in a Linux kernel source tree. Overwrite the
existing files in scripts/kconfig. Then run:

    make exconfig
 
 in the Kernel base directory. The current version of the extractor has been
 compiled with the Linux 2.6.32 source tree.

Changes
-------

0.2

- Support 'requires' statement used in old Kconfig specifications. The
  'requires' keyword is treated the same as 'depends on'
    - See http://www.mail-archive.com/kbuild-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg02447.html
